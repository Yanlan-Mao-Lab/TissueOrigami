## Developer conventions

Developers are expected to follow the conventions described here.

* **Development on branches**  
Development should happen primarily on a separate branch and merged into `ARCCollaboration` (the main development branch) via a pull request (PR). Changes should not be pushed directly to the main development branch (this cannot be enforced in private repositories).

TODO branch naming convention?

* **Pull request review**  
At least the approval of one other developer is required before merging a PR. Should the reviewer have no comments or changes they'd like to request, they can merge immediately after approval. Alternatively, they can approve and 

* **Merging a Pull Request**  
Development branches should be deleted after merging. Avoid squashing the commits on merging, create a merge commit instead.
