//For creating meshes from the outlines (e.g. wing discs), we changed one line in the triangle folder/make file:
	#FOR LINUX VERSION
	#CSWITCHES = -O -DLINUX -I/usr/X11R6/include -L/usr/X11R6/lib
	#FOR MAC VERSION
	CSWITCHES = -O -I/usr/X11R6/include -L/usr/X11R6/lib


FORMAT OF THE OUTPUT MESH:
[number of nodes]
for each node:
[x-coord   y-coord   z-coord]  [tissuePlacement: basal-node identifier(0)] [tissueType(columnar-0, peripodium-2)]  [flag for border nodes]
[number of elements]
[shape type =1 for prism] [node ids, 6 of them for prism, zero indexed] [reference position of each node, [x,y,z] for 6 nodes =18 values, this should be the original position you defined]

//SMALL ORGANOID WITHOUT ECM
1. Prepare the tessellation in Matlab (/NargessCodes/SphericalMesh.m). The radius is 20 microns and desired side length is 5. The output file is called "SmallSphericalTriangulation".
2. Copy the file into /ToolBox/MeshGeneration/2DEllipse/ and rename to SphericalTriangulation.
3. In EllipseFromOutline.cpp, change tissueType: selectTissueType = 5. 
4. Set ECM height to negative. This will then remove the ECM:
	ECMHeight = 0.2; //this should be set to negative in order to remove the ECM
5. After running the first two lines in the beginning of this text file, run:
	./EllipseFromOutline -2 12.3 2 4 1
Here I have reduced the ABHeight 12.5 to 12.3, because the original height of ECM was 0.2 and I am now removing it. Also I have reduced the number of layers from 5 to 4.
6. The output is MeshFile.out. Rename it as appropriate.

//LARGE ORGANOID WITHOUT ECM
1. Prepare the tessellation in Matlab (/NargessCodes/SphericalMesh.m). The radius is 20 microns and desired side length is 5. The output file is called "LargeSphericalTriangulation".
2. Copy the file into /ToolBox/MeshGeneration/2DEllipse/ and rename to SphericalTriangulation.
3. In EllipseFromOutline.cpp, change tissueType: selectTissueType = 5. 
4. Set ECM height to negative. This will then remove the ECM:
	ECMHeight = 0.2; //this should be set to negative in order to remove the ECM
5. After running the first two lines in the beginning of this text file, run:

//SMALL ORGANOID WITH ECM

4. After running the first two lines in the beginning of this text file, run:
	./EllipseFromOutline -2 12.5 2 5 1
5. The output is MeshFile.out. Rename it as appropriate.


//LARGE ORGANOID WITH ECM
1. Prepare the tessellation in Matlab (/NargessCodes/SphericalMesh.m). The radius is 100 microns and desired side length is 5. The output file is called "LargeSphericalTriangulation".
2. Copy the file into /ToolBox/MeshGeneration/2DEllipse/ and rename to SphericalTriangulation.
3. In EllipseFromOutline.cpp, change tissueType: selectTissueType = 5.

//SMALL 48H DISC WITH ECM AND PERIPODIAL
1. In the cpp file, correct selectTissueType to 1 and addPeripodial = true.
2. Small 48 hours. The average is 85.56 to 54.6 microns. The cross point at 50 microns.
Without taking the curve region into account this translates to a shape of:
35.56 50 27.3 27.3. Height is 12.5 but it is irrelevant because we will not use this mesh. It is too coarse because the side length is 9. Run:
	./EllipseFromOutline 1 35.56 50 27.3 27.3 12.5 9 2 0  ./inputOutlines/48hrDiscOutline
This might have a segmentation fault but we don't care. We only need the first mesh: Points.1.node and Points.1.ele.
3. Now we will refine the mesh. This will make the mesh finer:
%further refinements, same as above:
../triangle/triangle -rq33a27.44 Points.1
../triangle/triangle -rq33a10.4 Points.2
../triangle/triangle -rq33a5.8 Points.3
../triangle/triangle -rq33a2.8 Points.4
../triangle/triangle -rq33a0.65 Points.5
4. Copy the refinement that you are interested at into Points.1:
cp Points.3.ele Points.1.ele
cp Points.3.node Points.1.node
5. Now from this mesh, build the 3D tissue. We will start from basal and move upwards.
./EllipseFromOutline -1 12.7 2 3 1 
12.7 is the tissue height (12.5+0.2ECM), side length 2 although it is not used, 3 layers for test purposes and 1 for y-symmetry.
6. Rename the mesh file
cp MeshFile.out ./SmallExp48hWithPeriWithECM.mesh
