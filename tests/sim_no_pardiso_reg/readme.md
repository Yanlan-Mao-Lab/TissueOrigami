## Conducting the tests

The inputs for each test case `x` can be found in the respective `run0700x` directory.
In order to avoid hard-coded paths, the input files have had any absolute paths in them replaced by relative paths, _assuming that these files are now present in the same directory as the executable_ `TissueFolding`, when it is executed.
